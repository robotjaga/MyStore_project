Ecommerce Website Frontend (Product Detail Page)
This HTML file represents a product detail page for an ecommerce website, specifically showcasing a Prada belt product. The page is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and jQuery/Owl Carousel for styling, icons, and interactivity.

Code Explanation
1. Document Structure and Meta
The document starts with a standard HTML5 doctype and sets the language to English.

The <head> section includes meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings to ensure responsiveness on mobile devices.

The title of the page is set to "Ecommerce Website using PHP and MySQL".

2. Styles and External Resources
Several CSS files are linked:

Bootstrap CSS (versions 4.4.1 and 5.3.3) for responsive layout and styling.

Font Awesome for icon fonts used (e.g., cart icon, star ratings).

Owl Carousel CSS for the carousel/slider styling.

A custom CSS file styleheader.css is included (likely contains custom header styles).

An internal <style> block defines:

General page styles (fonts, layout, buttons).

Responsive media queries for smaller screens.

Styling for the product featured section including images, hover effects, and layout.

Styling for the footer and buttons.

3. Navbar
The page contains two navbars:

Primary Navbar (navbar-expand-lg with a logo, navigation links including Home, Register, About Us, a shopping cart icon with item count, and total price display).

Secondary Navbar (white background) showing user welcome text and login/register links.

The navbars are responsive with toggle buttons for small screens.

4. Featured Product Section
This section highlights the Prada Belt product.

The section contains:

A heading/title (PRADA BELT).

A two-column layout using flexbox:

Left column: Displays a large product image (big-image) and multiple smaller thumbnail images (small-image).

Right column: Contains product details such as product name, star ratings using Font Awesome stars, a product description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

Thumbnail images are clickable and change the large image dynamically using JavaScript (click on small images updates the big image source).

5. Footer
The footer is included via a PHP include statement (include("./footer.php")), so the actual footer content is modular and located in a separate file.

This keeps the code organized and reusable.

6. JavaScript and Interactivity
Bootstrap JS bundle for responsive components like navbar toggling.

jQuery and Owl Carousel for sliders (though not explicitly used in this page, included for site-wide use).

A small custom JavaScript snippet that listens for clicks on the small product images and updates the large main image accordingly.

7. Responsive Design
Media queries ensure the page looks good on mobile and tablet devices by adjusting flex direction, image sizes, fonts, and button sizes.
